# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project is part of my CodSoft internship. It focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection
Gathered a comprehensive dataset containing credit card transactions, providing a solid foundation for model development.

2. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization, ensuring data quality and consistency.

3. Feature Engineering
Selected and created relevant features from the dataset, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

4. Model Selection
Tested various machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model for fraud detection.

5. Model Training
Trained the selected model on the preprocessed data, optimizing its performance and accuracy.

6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness.

7. Deployment
Created a script to run the model and detect fraud in new transactions, enabling real-time fraud detection and prevention.

## Results

- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 0.96%.
- Detailed evaluation metrics for each model are provided in the results section.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the required dependencies before running the project. You can install them using:
