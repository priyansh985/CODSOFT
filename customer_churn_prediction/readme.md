# Customer Churn Prediction

This project is part of my internship at CodSoft. The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction involves identifying customers who are likely to cancel a subscription or stop using a service. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: 
    - Gather customer data from various sources such as databases, CRM systems, and third-party providers.
    - Ensure data is comprehensive and includes relevant features like customer demographics, transaction history, and service usage.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
    - Normalize or standardize the data to ensure uniformity.
    - Encode categorical variables and perform any necessary transformations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    - Visualize the data using plots and charts to identify trends and patterns.
    - Perform statistical analysis to understand relationships between different features.
    - Identify and handle outliers that may skew the analysis.

4. **Feature Engineering**: 
    - Create new features that can provide additional insights or improve model performance.
    - Select the most relevant features using techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance scores.
    - Perform dimensionality reduction if necessary to simplify the model.

5. **Model Selection**: 
    - Research and choose appropriate machine learning models that are well-suited for classification tasks.
    - Consider models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.

6. **Model Training**: 
    - Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
    - Train the selected models on the training data using appropriate algorithms and techniques.
    - Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

7. **Model Evaluation**: 
    - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
    - Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.
    - Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the types of errors made by the model.

8. **Model Tuning**: 
    - Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize its performance.
    - Use techniques like grid search or random search to find the best hyperparameter values.
    - Validate the tuned model on a separate validation set to ensure it performs well.

9. **Deployment**: 
    - Deploy the best model to a production environment where it can make real-time predictions.
    - Set up monitoring and logging to track the model's performance over time.
    - Continuously update the model with new data to maintain its accuracy and relevance.
